I created this Python GUI application to help students visualize complex mathematical concepts and help check applied linear algebra answers. 

Using Tkinter, I built an interactive suite that generates step-by-step solutions for linear algebra and applied linear algebra problems which then produces ready-to-use Octave code. The tool covers matrix operations, linear systems, eigenvalues, and linear programming. This project showed me how to make abstract mathematics accessible through software, while improving my UI design and numerical computation skills.
